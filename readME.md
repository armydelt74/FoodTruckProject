## Food Truck Project

### Week 3 Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Overview

Overview
Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck.

Structure
You will define a FoodTruck class with fields for a unique numeric id, a name, food type, and a numeric rating.

FoodTruckStart is a separate class with a main method that starts the program.

It will have an array to store up to five FoodTruck objects. The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

FoodTruckStart.java notes:
The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks. For each set of input, a FoodTruck object is created, its fields set to the user's input, and it is added to the array.

FoodTruck.Java notes:
The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created.

Expected user input/response:
- If the user inputs "quit" for the food truck name, input ends immediately and the program continues.
- After input is complete, the user sees a menu from which they can choose to:
MENU:
- List all existing food trucks.
- See the average rating of food trucks.
- Display the highest-rated food truck.
- Quit the program.

After choosing a menu item, the user sees the menu again and can choose another item until the choose to quit.
